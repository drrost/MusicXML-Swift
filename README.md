# MusicXML-Swift: Parsing and Drawing
Swift implementation for MusicXML format (parsing and drawing)

See more details [here](https://www.musicxml.com).

The framework is on the beginning of its development, it doesn't have any releases yet.

I use this library in my own projects but it's likely that someone will need something that
is absent here. Please don't hesitate to post feature requests.
